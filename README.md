**ReactJS test project**

I am creating a test project to learn ReactJS.
This project will contain my own home page that will have the following below:

- Detailed explanation of my blog topics. (Blog URL is located ericbanks31.blogspot.com)
- Link to my GitHub URL
- Link to my developer blog.
- Show some details about myself.
- Show some interests that I have in programming and outside of programming.

I am learning to put HTML sections, such as navigation bar, header, body content, footer 
, into different components and having ReactJS renders these components to valid HTML.
